Title :- Heart Disease Analysis Using Python Pandas 🩺🔍 

🚀 Excited to share my latest project on Heart Disease Analysis using Python and Pandas! 🚀
In this project, I performed a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the factors contributing to heart disease. Here's a quick overview of what I did:
1.	Imported Libraries and Dataset: Utilized Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation.
2.	Explored Dataset: Displayed top and bottom rows to understand data structure.
3.	Dataset Insights: Analyzed the shape, null values, and duplicates.
4.	Statistics: Generated overall statistics to grasp data distributions.
5.	Correlation Matrix: Visualized relationships between variables.
6.	Heart Disease Count: Analyzed the prevalence of heart disease in the dataset.
7.	Gender Distribution: Examined the distribution of male and female patients.
8.	Age and Chest Pain Types: Explored age distribution and types of chest pain.
9.	Blood Pressure and Cholesterol: Investigated blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
10.	Visualizations: Created plots for continuous variables and distributions.
💡 Key Takeaway: The insights derived from this analysis can help in understanding key factors related to heart disease and can be used to inform further research or predictive modeling.
